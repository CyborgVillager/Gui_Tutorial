============
Basic Info
===========

PyQT_tutorial_files will be a new learning experience for the development of potentially new Gui projects that I will
work on. I will still work with Kivy due to having some experience with it during the fall semester of 2019. But
for now I will test the circuits of PyQt and then weigh my options on either Kivy or PyQt.

Heres the links that Ill be using to further learn about PyQt
links:
https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial
https://codeloop.org/pyqt5-creating-first-window/

Once I'm done with the basic introduction and a couple of mini-projects Ill re-evaluate and work from there.
Anyhow have a great day, and feel free to look around the code a bit, you might learn something new.
