============
Basic Info
===========

Will be using this respo to further learn about python tkinter and its many functionalities.
This is will pretty much be a way for me to review/check code if I have any questions on future gui projects. A good
reference point, and build it up from there.

Theres still much to be learned and many ways to implement ideas,thoughts, and new projects. So this is a good
stepping stone for that to become a reality.

Anyhow if you would like to learn about tkinter feel free to check my code out, you might learn something new.

Other resources to further learn about tkinter :

============
Other Info
===========
Once I'm done with the intro on tkint will go back to kivy/ learn a bit more about PyQt
Once those 2 objectives are completed Ill have to decide what Ill be using
for the project either kivy or PyQt. All of this info will be updated onto this respo, until I go into
verison1 of it.
