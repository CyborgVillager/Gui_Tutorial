============
Basic Info
===========

Will be using this respo to further learn about python tkinter and its many functionalities.
This is will pretty much be a way for me to review/check code if I have any questions on future gui projects. A good
reference point, and build it up from there.

Theres still much to be learned and many ways to implement ideas,thoughts, and new projects. So this is a good
stepping stone for that to become a reality.

Anyhow if you would like to learn about tkinter feel free to check my code out, you might learn something new.
