v0:  Introduction & Setting Up
        Introduction to python tkinter & its gui functionality , setting up the verion_info.txt,readme.txt, and pyvenv
            files

v1: Source Folder Import & tkint_version0.py

        Made a 'source' folder to host any imports needed for the program to operate, without spamming the py file
        that the user would like to open.

        After that made a folder called tkint_version0 to hold the introductory information regarding on using tkinter
        tkint_version1 and so on will have a bit more depth to tkinter, will modify this if need be.

        Lastly created a file window_tkinter0.py that will make a window to pop up


v2 Quit Button Placement: created a .py file named button_tkinter1.py in which contains a quit button as well
                                its relative location to the windows max size, and included a custom title for the
                                opened window as well

--:v3 Quit Button Functionality Activated: created a file named quit_button_functionality_tkinter2.py
                                            This example will allow the user to click on the button 'Quit' to close
                                            the program, instead of pressing the X on the top right of the window, they
                                            can click the button 'Quit' as a replacement
