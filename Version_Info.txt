               | --------------------------- |
               | v# : Short Version Title    |
               | Description: v# description |
               | --------------------------- |


v0  Introduction & Setting Up:
        Introduction to python tkinter & its gui functionality , setting up the verion_info.txt,readme.txt, and pyvenv
            files

v1 Source Folder Import & tkint_version0.py:

        Made a 'source' folder to host any imports needed for the program to operate, without spamming the py file
        that the user would like to open.

        After that made a folder called tkint_version0 to hold the introductory information regarding on using tkinter
        tkint_version1 and so on will have a bit more depth to tkinter, will modify this if need be.

        Lastly created a file window_tkinter0.py that will make a window to pop up


v2 Quit Button Placement: created a .py file named button_tkinter1.py in which contains a quit button as well
                                its relative location to the windows max size, and included a custom title for the
                                opened window as well

v3 Quit Button Functionality: Activated: created a file named quit_button_functionality_tkinter2.py
                                            This example will allow the user to click on the button 'Quit' to close
                                            the program, instead of pressing the X on the top right of the window, they
                                            can click the button 'Quit' as a replacement
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v4 Basic Menu & Quit Personality:
        Made a basic menu @ menu_tkinter3.py. Will work further on this to give it more functionality on tkint_version1
        For now getting the basics in and learning the support structure on making such programs
        Besides that testing some other ways on giving the program some more options, and found a
        thread relating to it -> Acquired from https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/threads/66698/exit-a-tkinter-gui-program
         Other options if a user would like to shut down the program.
         Will look further into this to make the program more interactive and to help aid in A.i development as well
         Could be good to give an A.i for the program some personality/piszas
         Also heres the stack overflow in regarding to using this for .Py 3
         https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38181710/tkmessagebox-no-module/38181986

v4.5 Updated menu_tkinter3.py:  comments go a in-depth
                                    regarding the .py information  functionality of the functions/info
                                    Edit: Disabled def client_exit(self): @ line 49-50 for the time being

v5 Menu allows image/text to be shown:
        img_text_tkinter1.py Menu allows images & text to be shown, still need some more work in regarding the main
        functionality of it Besides that the program works as intented.
        Installed pillow on the interpt & made a source file for it, called pillow_lib_tk.py
        this is needed for the menu to work correctly
        Edit: will check the link http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/text.htm#patterns for more info in regarding
        to text widgets
v6 Intro of Kivy/PyQt : As of now Ill focus on kivy , which I've started to learn 1st for the calculator @
            https://github.com/CyborgVillager/UpdatedCacl, & try out pyQt. will dive into the intro information to get
            a good grounding of the situation. Once those 2 objectives are completed Ill have to decide what Ill be using
            for the project either kivy or PyQt. All of this info will be updated onto this respo, until I go into
            verison1 of it.
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v7 Re-configured the layout: of the folders to include PyQt/organized the code a bit. Besides that made 2 new folders
        One for the source code for PyQt, while the other to host PyQt programs, to make it sepearte from
            tkint_tutorial_files, which contain the previous versions of tkint programs.
            For PyQt source code just imported -> from PyQt5 import QtGui  &
                                                     from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
            to save space on the main programs, besides that made a new .py file called
                                                     window_pyqt0 which makes a new window

v8 Close the program: Made a .py file called button_pyqt1 which will create a window, and afterwords will close
                        the program if a user has clicked 'Close Application', this also includes a pop up if a user has
                        hovered over it.
                        Button Key Legend @ line 21-23
                        button location left -> + = right , - = left, top -> + = bottom, - = top, width -> + = size increase, less
                         size decrease, same for height

v9 Signal Communications: basic info, the button from def createbutton will create a 'signal' to the program to close
                            the program by connecting to the function buttonaction which closes
                            the program due to having sys.exit()

                            The program file name is signal_comms_pyqt2.py which will hold v9 information on closing
                            the program. Its quite similiar to v8 Close the program
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v10 Layout HBox Gui: introduction to gui layout for buttons @ layout_pyqt3.py, the program asks for the user's fav
                        programming language with the included close app button as well. The buttons are non-functional
                            at the moment.

v11 Gui Grid Layout:  grid_layout_pyqt3.py -> the program will make a continaer that will let the buttons/
                    widgets show in a grid like pattern, similiar to layout_pyqt3
                new tutorial pyqt colors tutorial : https://pythonspot.com/pyqt5-colors/

v12 Gui Label Text: the program gird_label_text_pyqt5.py will show the user a hello text & basic info of the
                        program / e.g the user's dashboard

v13 Pixmap Tutorial: new program that allows the user to see an image/background can be seen @ add_image_pyqt7.py
                        To scale an image use the stackoverflow link for more in-depth answer.
                        Implemented the responder's answer to re-size the overly large image to fit onto a smaller
                        screen, if a user has a small screen
                   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21802868/python-how-to-resize-raster-image-with-pyqt
                   also updated pyqt_source.py to allow images to be processed with pixmap
                   -> from PyQt5.QtGui import QPixmap

v14 Radio Buttons: on py program radio_buttons_pyqt7 the user will have to choose either of 3 options
                    once they have selected an option a result will appear repating a text of what they
                        have selected

v15 Update File Names -> For Readability: Updated the file names for better organization / readability, by
                                        ordering them 0 -> which is first, 1-> second,
                                            2-> third, and so on, and also created a new
                                                .py called checkbox_with_signals_pyqt, will update on the next version
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v16 Checkbox w/signals: User will have to select a checbox to get a response, similiar to other checkbox examples
                        in html.

                        After working on a couple of examples, Ill go back to kivy, due to better gui. Good
                        for using on other devices/design is easy on the eyes, etc. Will use Kivy to make the application
                        If your interested in learning more about PyQt feel free to check out the link:
                        https://codeloop.org/category/pyqt5/
                        for more info.

                        Had to do a bit of digging on this subject, been contemplating/resh of which I should
                        primarly focus on, after a couple of reads, backend experience, and videos on this subject
                        Kivy tops it off.

                        Will update this respo to include a couple of Kivy examples/tutorials. After that will make
                        a new respo dedicated to the kivy project.

                        Edit: Updated the project name to Gui_Tutorial -> Updated the respo @ github to Gui_Tutorial

v17 Added Kivy Info : Added fall semester 2019 code for kivy as a reference, besides that made 2 new folders to hold
                       a pong game and some basic info regarding kivy. All of this is hosted onto a file
                       called Kivy_tutorial_files

                       Edit: install this onto your terminal if your having an error / unable to find windows
                       python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew
                       https://kivy.org/doc/stable/installation/installation-windows.html#installation

                       other info relating to this ->
                       https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40697876/unable-to-get-a-window-abort

v18 Basic Pong Info: 2 new files -> On folder pong_games will contain 2 files -> 0pong_tut.py contains the program to
                        run the pong game, while the other file pong.kv will hold the graphics that the
                         user will see on their screen
v19 Pong Game: full version of Pong game tutorial complete feel free to check out the link to see more ->
        https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/pong.html, will now work on refreshing the basics from kivy_app_tutorial_00
        after that will work on the project
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
--v20 Forked Kivy: forked kivy onto this project, will be using the forked, and the fall semester as a
                    reference when working on the project, Will create a new respo called Kivy_Project0.
                    This will be a test run on re-learning the ropes

        of kivy. After a day of testing on the 12th of 1/20 will be working on the project. Once that is completed
        will re-work on django and make a temp site to host the program. So instead of having a ide to launch the
        program you just have to run the application by clicking on it. will have to learn on how to compile the
        code into an .exe.

        Besides that this respo has been fun and exciting, have so many plans & ideas on using this to its full potential
        and will continue to test out kivy to its limit once I implement a couple of A.i prototypes into the mix.
        2020 will be an interesting year for me, and potentially for you as well. A lot of changes will happen that will
        not only benefit me, but also benefit other people as well.

        As long you keep on moving forward with an idea/plan you will be alright. Just remeber that there will be a couple
        of bumps along the way, and remember thats part of life. Use those bumps to your advantage by learning from
        them, and see it for it's true colors. Keep your mind open, but also take into consideration the logical aspects
        of it as well. Remember that we as a species are both logical & emotional in nature. Thanks to those 2 aspects
        our species has come from the stone age filled with dangers and perils that today many would not dare
        would want to face.

        Thanks to those sacrfices on learning about our world and its many wonders & dangers we
        as a species has made the wild world called Earth our home. We have terraform it to suit our needs for survial
        and for pleasure/entertainment. Theres so much out there begging to be discovered in either history,science,
        and the great unknown it fills me with excitment knowing that working on this, and by furthing increasing my
        knowledge in programming. I am able to create ideas into reality, give them form and shape. As same for our
        ancestors when they brought there idea's of the wheel, farming, metal forging, arts & craft, and even religion
        into a reality! We are both creators & destroyers the caretakers & plunders of this great world called Earth.

        I am confident that our species, will continue to advance and make other worlds our home as well. With the advent
        of A.i and their ever increasing intelligence we can also have them by our sides giving this universe a breath of
        new life. As of now humans are the tree while A.i is its fruit. Soon the fruit will drop from the tree and sprout
        a into a new tree of unlimited potential. Hopefully our generation will get to see the A.i fruit come into
        a blossom. If not then im glad that I and our generation has helped in the assistance in putting in the fertilizer
        for the A.I seed. This is also in thanks to our previous generation for putting the seed into existence, and
        neccassary nutrion and structure into a reality as well.

        To the arts & crafts for creating many, many outtakes of A.i, future
        technology, future history, and for the both postive & negative aspects of it. To science & history on the
        effort into making the technology/ideas into a reality that will improve the lives of many, many lives for our planet.
        Despite the setbacks of harm that has come to our species and to the numerous times of potential exiction events
        our species, have & will continue to do the un-expected, continue to thrive under both harsh and lucrative
        conditions. No matter the take of the environment or era, we have continued to go above and beyond for any
        species to have ever existed on our world, and possibility the universe as well.

        Theres so much to learn and do, its unbearable. Use your time wisely and remember to do your out-most best,
        your playing iron man mode after all. The future is ours, lets change history together for the benefit of
        mankind and for its many, many inhabitants on our lush-green watery world called Earth.

        Take care, and unleash your hidden potential to the fullest
        Sincerly,
        ~ JA
