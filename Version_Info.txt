               | v# : Short Version Title    |
               | Description: v# description |
               | --------------------------- |


v0  Introduction & Setting Up:
        Introduction to python tkinter & its gui functionality , setting up the verion_info.txt,readme.txt, and pyvenv
            files

v1 Source Folder Import & tkint_version0.py:

        Made a 'source' folder to host any imports needed for the program to operate, without spamming the py file
        that the user would like to open.

        After that made a folder called tkint_version0 to hold the introductory information regarding on using tkinter
        tkint_version1 and so on will have a bit more depth to tkinter, will modify this if need be.

        Lastly created a file window_tkinter0.py that will make a window to pop up


v2 Quit Button Placement: created a .py file named button_tkinter1.py in which contains a quit button as well
                                its relative location to the windows max size, and included a custom title for the
                                opened window as well

v3 Quit Button Functionality: Activated: created a file named quit_button_functionality_tkinter2.py
                                            This example will allow the user to click on the button 'Quit' to close
                                            the program, instead of pressing the X on the top right of the window, they
                                            can click the button 'Quit' as a replacement
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v4 Basic Menu & Quit Personality:
        Made a basic menu @ menu_tkinter3.py. Will work further on this to give it more functionality on tkint_version1
        For now getting the basics in and learning the support structure on making such programs
        Besides that testing some other ways on giving the program some more options, and found a
        thread relating to it -> Acquired from https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/threads/66698/exit-a-tkinter-gui-program
         Other options if a user would like to shut down the program.
         Will look further into this to make the program more interactive and to help aid in A.i development as well
         Could be good to give an A.i for the program some personality/piszas
         Also heres the stack overflow in regarding to using this for .Py 3
         https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38181710/tkmessagebox-no-module/38181986

v4.5 Updated menu_tkinter3.py:  comments go a in-depth
                                    regarding the .py information  functionality of the functions/info
                                    Edit: Disabled def client_exit(self): @ line 49-50 for the time being

v5 Menu allows image/text to be shown:
        img_text_tkinter1.py Menu allows images & text to be shown, still need some more work in regarding the main
        functionality of it Besides that the program works as intented.
        Installed pillow on the interpt & made a source file for it, called pillow_lib_tk.py
        this is needed for the menu to work correctly
        Edit: will check the link http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/text.htm#patterns for more info in regarding
        to text widgets
v6 Intro of Kivy/PyQt : As of now Ill focus on kivy , which I've started to learn 1st for the calculator @
            https://github.com/CyborgVillager/UpdatedCacl, & try out pyQt. will dive into the intro information to get
            a good grounding of the situation. Once those 2 objectives are completed Ill have to decide what Ill be using
            for the project either kivy or PyQt. All of this info will be updated onto this respo, until I go into
            verison1 of it.
----------------------------    ----------------------------   ------------------------- ------------------------------
v7 Re-configured the layout: of the folders to include PyQt/organized the code a bit. Besides that made 2 new folders
        One for the source code for PyQt, while the other to host PyQt programs, to make it sepearte from
            tkint_tutorial_files, which contain the previous versions of tkint programs.
            For PyQt source code just imported -> from PyQt5 import QtGui  &
                                                     from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
            to save space on the main programs, besides that made a new .py file called
                                                     window_pyqt0 which makes a new window

v8 Close the program: Made a .py file called button_pyqt1 which will create a window, and afterwords will close
                        the program if a user has clicked 'Close Application', this also includes a pop up if a user has
                        hovered over it.
                        Button Key Legend @ line 21-23
                        button location left -> + = right , - = left, top -> + = bottom, - = top, width -> + = size increase, less
                         size decrease, same for height

--v9 Signal Communications: basic info, the button from def createbutton will create a 'signal' to the program to close
                            the program by connecting to the function buttonaction which closes
                            the program due to having sys.exit()

                            The program file name is signal_comms_pyqt2.py which will hold v9 information on closing
                            the program. Its quite similiar to v8 Close the program
