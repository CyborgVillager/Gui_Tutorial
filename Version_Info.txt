               | Description: v# description |
               | --------------------------- |


v0:  Introduction & Setting Up
        Introduction to python tkinter & its gui functionality , setting up the verion_info.txt,readme.txt, and pyvenv
            files

v1: Source Folder Import & tkint_version0.py

        Made a 'source' folder to host any imports needed for the program to operate, without spamming the py file
        that the user would like to open.

        After that made a folder called tkint_version0 to hold the introductory information regarding on using tkinter
        tkint_version1 and so on will have a bit more depth to tkinter, will modify this if need be.

        Lastly created a file window_tkinter0.py that will make a window to pop up


v2 Quit Button Placement: created a .py file named button_tkinter1.py in which contains a quit button as well
                                its relative location to the windows max size, and included a custom title for the
                                opened window as well

v3 Quit Button Functionality Activated: created a file named quit_button_functionality_tkinter2.py
                                            This example will allow the user to click on the button 'Quit' to close
                                            the program, instead of pressing the X on the top right of the window, they
                                            can click the button 'Quit' as a replacement

--v4 Basic Menu & Quit Personality:
        Made a basic menu @ menu_tkinter3.py. Will work further on this to give it more functionality on tkint_version1
        For now getting the basics in and learning the support structure on making such programs
        Besides that testing some other ways on giving the program some more options, and found a
        thread relating to it -> Acquired from https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/threads/66698/exit-a-tkinter-gui-program
         Other options if a user would like to shut down the program.
         Will look further into this to make the program more interactive and to help aid in A.i development as well
         Could be good to give an A.i for the program some personality/piszas
         Also heres the stack overflow in regarding to using this for .Py 3
