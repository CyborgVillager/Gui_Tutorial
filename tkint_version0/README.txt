============
Basic Info About tkint_version0
===========

tkint_version0 will hold the introductory information regarding on using tkinter
tkint_version1 and so on will have a bit more depth to tkinter, will modify this if need be.

Once I'm done with the intro on tkint will go back to kivy/ learn a bit more about PyQt
Once those 2 objectives are completed Ill have to decide what Ill be using
for the project either kivy or PyQt. All of this info will be updated onto this respo, until I go into
verison1 of it.

As of now this will be the process for this mini-project
