Kivy tutorial for reference. Will be using Kivy to create a bigger project.
As of now this will hold a fall semester notes called Kivy_App_Tutorial00, and a new folder called basic_intro
A mini project will be a pong game -> https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/pong.html#introduction

After that will work on the project. Feel free to check out the code to learn a bit more about Kivy!
